### Dynamic Report + RLS + Bookmark in Power BI
In this exercise, I have done the following:
1. Created a dynamic report that shows visualisations for each gender by using Slicers.
2. Added 3 bookmark buttons allows us to customise our views. (Ctrl+click on bookmark button to acces the view)
3. Created a role(Only 50) where all our visualisations are filtered for data with Ocuurences <= 50.
