# SOLID Principles Demonstration using Python 

SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles in practice. They are:
1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle.
2. **O**pen-Closed Principle.
3. **L**iskov Subtituion Principle.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle. 
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle.

Each Principle is demonstrated in such a way that, a little python program is written before and after implementation of respective principle that underlies the importance of using it.
